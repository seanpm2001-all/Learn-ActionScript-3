### Learning ActionScript 3.0

![/ActionScript_icon.png](/ActionScript_icon.png)

I know very little about ActionScript 3.0, but I have no way of testing programs either. These are all the pieces of knowledge I know about ActionScript 3.0.

#### Hello World in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
package // Hello world program
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;
    import flash.text.TextField;
    
    public class actionscript extends Sprite
    {
        private var hello:TextField = new TextField();
        
        public function actionscript(){
            hello.text = "Hello, World!";
            addChild(hello);
        }
    }
}
```

This is just a copied example. It outputs a standard Hello World program. To complete this section, this is the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Classes in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
public function someFunction()
{
	hello.text = "Dysfunctional function";
}
public class Main
{
return someFunction();
}
```

This is an example of classes in ActionScript. I had to prematurely include a function and a `return` statement, so the class could do something.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Functions in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
public function someFunction()
{
	hello.text = "Dysfunctional function";
}
return someFunction();
```

This is an example of classes in ActionScript. I had to prematurely include a `return` statement, so the function could do something.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Return in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
public function someFunction()
{
	hello.text = "Dysfunctional function";
}
return someFunction();
```

There wasn't much to add, so this is just a copy of the `Functions in ActionScript 3.0` section.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Objects in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
new MyCustomObject(stage);
```

This is not a complete example, but this is an example of a stage object in ActionScript 3.0.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Break keyword in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Comments in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
// This is a comment
/* This is 
a block
comment */
/* Block comments
* can also
* be written
* like this */
```

Comments in ActionScript are very traditional, and similar to languages like C, C++, Java, C#, and so on.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Variables in ActionScript 3.0

```actionscript
var set variable1 = 1
var set stringvar1 = "I don't know if this is valid
```

I think that you have to set variables with the `set` keyword. I don't know if variables can hold strings.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_
